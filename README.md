# MahjongTiles.jl

Basic utilities for representing and working with Mahjong tiles and hands
(this package works in a similar way to 
[PlayingCards.jl](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/PlayingCards/I6MLG/0.3.0)).

## TODO
- [ ] generate a new keypair using `DocumenterTools.genkeys()` and save to GitHub
